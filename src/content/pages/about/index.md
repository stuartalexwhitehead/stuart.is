I’m a friendly, experienced web developer working at [Springload](https://www.springload.co.nz) in New Zealand. I’m responsible for a team of 6 developers and oversee the delivery of a pretty interesting Government service. I hold a degree in Computer Science and have 7 years of professional experience. In 2016 I was named Scotland IS “Young Software Engineer of the Year” which was really bloody cool.

Web development has forever been a passion of mine and I enjoy working at any layer of the web stack. I favour JavaScript (client and server-side), Python and AWS which are great tools for solving complex UI, data modelling and integration challenges. I’ve achieved multiple AWS certifications (including [Developer Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) and [SysOps Administator Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)) which help to fuel my curiosity.

I love working on collaborative projects where thoughtful design is a core focus. I think this stems from my time in brand and design agencies — I hold great memories from [FortyTwo Studio](https://www.fortytwo.studio/) and my internship at [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com). I was also very fortunate to take part in [Mobile User Experience](https://pmn.co.uk/mex/) a few times, where I met some incredibly smart and forward-thinking designers.

More recently my focus has been on mentoring and engineering management. There’s an awesome programme in Wellington called “[Winter Mentor](https://wintermentor.com/)” — I’ve been mentoring at it since the start and it’s always fascinating. I also love taking part in other community events like [Django Girls Wellington](https://djangogirls.org/wellington/) and [Create Camp](https://twitter.com/StuartWhitehead/status/1033833001325490178). In a professional capacity, my role has evolved to include management duties like hiring, 1-on-1s and annual reviews.
